# Expo ImagePicker Bug: Empty or Incomplete Image Array

This repository demonstrates a rare bug in Expo's ImagePicker library where, when selecting multiple images, the returned array of image URIs is sometimes empty or incomplete. This issue doesn't occur consistently and is difficult to reproduce reliably, making it a challenging bug to identify and fix. 

## Problem
The `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync` function, when used with `mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.All`, and `selectionLimit` set to a value greater than 1, occasionally returns an empty or incomplete array of `assets`.  This means not all selected images are returned, leading to unexpected behavior in your application.

## Solution
The core problem lies in how the application handles the asynchronous operations and how Expo ImagePicker might sometimes fail to return a complete array. The solution provided uses a timeout to address the scenario where the `ImagePicker` is delayed or fails to return results properly.  This does not fully resolve the core issue, but provides a workaround for this uncommon bug.

## How to Reproduce (Inconsistent)
While the exact conditions are not fully understood, the bug tends to manifest more frequently when:

* A large number of images are selected.
* The selection process is interrupted (e.g., user cancels selection).
* The device is under heavy load.

Consistent reproduction is unreliable. The provided solution aims to mitigate the issue but may not completely eliminate it in all cases.
